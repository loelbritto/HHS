# 3D Models Directory

This directory contains 3D models used in the Muscular System presentation website.

## Required Models

The website is designed to work with the following 3D model:

1. `human_body.glb` - A 3D model of the human body that showcases the muscular system

## How to Add Models

### Option 1: Download Free 3D Models

You can download free 3D models in GLB format from various sources:
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount) - Filter for downloadable models
- [Google Poly](https://poly.pizza/) - Many free 3D models
- [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free/glb) - Filter for free GLB models

After downloading, rename the file to `human_body.glb` and place it in this directory.

### Option 2: Create Your Own Models

If you have 3D modeling skills, you can create your own models using:
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (Free)
- [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) (Paid)
- [ZBrush](https://pixologic.com/) (Paid)

Export your model in GLB format and place it in this directory.

## Model Requirements

For optimal display on the website:
- Format: GLB (GL Transmission Format Binary)
- Size: Keep under 10MB for faster loading
- Complexity: Aim for under 100k polygons
- Scale: Model should be approximately 2 meters tall

## Note

The website includes fallback functionality that will display a colored cube if the 3D model is not found. While this ensures the website continues to function, adding a proper 3D model will significantly enhance the educational experience.
